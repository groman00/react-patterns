## Problems
- I have a class based component and I want to use hooks for managing state and performing side effects.
- I want to [capture rendered values](https://overreacted.io/how-are-function-components-different-from-classes/) in a single function.  [See Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/pjqnl16lm7)


## Solution
Use a functional component
